### Hello, I am Lulu, I work on data and technology.

I am an abstract thinker, both mathematically and philosophically. I build and
architect distributed systems for data and AI/ML applications. I enjoy good
design with technology, always look for ways to make the world a better place.

<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".tldr">tl;dr</a>

<div class="tldr collapse" style="margin-top: 2%">
  Graduated with MS in Computer Science specialized in machine learning and AI,
  MA in Economics and BA in Political Science.
  <br>
  Currently I am senior data engineer at Deloitte Digital building streamlined 
  and automated machine learning pipeline to shorten data science's experiment 
  to production time.
  <br>
  While not building new stuff, I enjoy thinking how to better software and
  infrastructure <b>by design</b> and leverage/re-purpose/combine new
  technologies to help organizations and people do things better and quicker.
  <br>
  Data has always been the center of my interest. Over past 7 years, I've worked
  with data in petabyte scale on 200 nodes cluster and few thousand records 
  survey data in pandas, both exploratory analysis and production grade ETL 
  architecture design and development.
  <br>
  I've run what people used to call 'statistical' analysis on survey data as 
  well as large scale distributed machine learning algorithms on sales data.
  <br>
  I've worked with various business functions - customer service, supply chain,
  manufacturing, market research, politics, health care to develop customized BI
  solutions from infrastructure to ETL pipelines to dashboards, I've built in 
  <code>d3.js</code> (free) as well as tableau ($$$$), with small organizations 
  with a team of 5 to enterprise with teams across 5 continents.
  <br>
  I am always excited about new data problems everyday whether that's 
  infrastructure or application or analytics to support product, technology is 
  just moving so fast that no two days are the same.
