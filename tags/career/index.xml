Disclaimer: I am no workplace expert. I am an average cog in the wheel who reads and thinks a lot on the subject (and perhaps have been through a few of the not so great workplaces myself) who would like to share some learnings and reflections over time. This also might or might not be a writing therapy in response to my worklife.</description></item><item><title>Managing Career Opportunities</title><link>https://l1990790120.github.io/post/2020-07-29-managing-career-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2020 23:37:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://l1990790120.github.io/post/2020-07-29-managing-career-opportunities/</guid><description>&lt;p>無意間看到有一些教人找工作的文章，我也有很多經驗，可是是找『好』工作的經驗。雖然工作上遇到很多機會不是人人都有的煩惱，但是我覺得這比找工作更讓人煩惱。找不到工作第一件事當然是想辦法找到工作，但是如果有很多份工作可以選，做出自己不會後悔的選擇是很困難的。一份工作有很多變數，薪水，挑戰性，connection，職涯發展，老闆，團隊。不討戰，找不到工作寄履歷給我，我會試著幫你。&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Custom Do You Really Need for Your Solution?</title><link>https://l1990790120.github.io/post/2020-04-23-how-custom-do-you-really-need-for-your-solution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:53:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://l1990790120.github.io/post/2020-04-23-how-custom-do-you-really-need-for-your-solution/</guid><description>Companies who could afford in-house engineering teams often have tendencies to build custom in-house solutions no matter how prevalent that solution already is. To highlight the absurdity, let me give an example: Jupyter Notebook. Despite the space being extremely competitive, Google has Colab, Amazon has Sagemaker, Azure, Databricks, Domino, Binder all offer similar services and the list goes on, Product or Technology still cannot resist the urge to build one (if not multiple) in-house.</description></item></channel></rss>
